## Part A: Downloading data to AWS

1. Data description

We will download several types of data:
- a human reference genome
- a set of Illumina reads
- the same set of reads but pre-aligned

To illustrate that download speeds are really fast on AWS, we chose to create our instance on the us-west-2 region, which happens to be the same region where the T2T human genome is hosted (https://github.com/marbl/CHM13).

So, specifically, we will retrieve:
- the CHM13v2 genome assembly v1.1
- Illumina PCR-free reads generated by T2T from CHM13
- the alignment BAM file of those reads using BWA mem

Why CHM13v1.1 and not v2.0, you ask? It's because at the time of writing, the alignment BAM files and many other analyses are available for v1.1 but not v2.

2. S3

S3 is the name of the storage service/protocol used by Amazon.
