# 2022 WABI Pangenome workshop hackathon (AWS intro)

This is a hackathon session where participants will perform themselves a cloud analysis using AWS. The goal of the session is to get first-hand experience in running a bioinformatics tasks with large resources, to see where the bottlenecks are, and inform on where algorithmic improvements are needed.

You will be given a temporary account valid only during for today's session. With this account you will be able to:

[Part A: Create, launch a AWS cloud instance](https://github.com/rchikhi/2022-pangenome-aws/blob/main/PartA.md)

[Part B: Download SRA data at lightning speed](https://github.com/rchikhi/2022-pangenome-aws/blob/main/PartB.md)

[Part C: Perform bioinformatics analyses](https://github.com/rchikhi/2022-pangenome-aws/blob/main/PartC.md)

[Part D: Cleanup the cloud resources after the analysis is performed](https://github.com/rchikhi/2022-pangenome-aws/blob/main/PartD.md)

**Warning**: Cloud analyses can end up being clostly. This session will be covered by Institut Pasteur, but please be mindful of not launching too large instances. You may check the https://instances.vantage.sh/ website for costs. 

This is a heavily guided introduction, with all the steps shown with screenshots. The screenshots are accurate as of September 2022, but the AWS interface may have changed later.
