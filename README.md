# 2022 WABI Pangenome workshop hackathon (AWS intro)

This is a hackathon session where participants will perform themselves a cloud analysis using AWS. The goal of the session is to get first-hand experience in running a bioinformatics tasks with large resources, to see where the bottlenecks are, and inform on where algorithmic improvements are needed.

You will be given a temporary account valid only during for today's session. With this account you will be able to:

[Part A: Create, launch a AWS cloud instance](https://github.com/rchikhi/2022-pangenome-aws/blob/main/PartA.md)

Part B: Download SRA data at lightning speed

Part C: Perform bioinformatics analyses

Part D: Cleanup the cloud resources after the analysis is performed

**Warning**: Cloud analyses can end up being clostly. This session will be covered by Institut Pasteur, but please be mindful of not launching too large instances. You may check the https://instances.vantage.sh/ website for costs. 

The rest of this document will guide you towards the steps.
